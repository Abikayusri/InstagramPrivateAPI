InstagramPrivateAPI
===================
Instagram Private API for Kotlin

**Love this project?**
It's not easy to handle a project while we're on working, so please contribute by porting features to this project.
----

**What is Instagram Private API?** 
Maybe you've experienced with the official API from Instagram, but you have a lot of trouble to access more complex API. So I decided to make
kotlin API wrapper to access private API. So you can directly login with password, follow, unfollow, like, post photo, etc.
Instagram gave a good service, please don't use this for spamming.

---

**What can you do with this API wrapper?** 
Pretty much anything that the Instagram PRIVATE API allows, except for some endpoints that you need to implement by yourself or made a pull request to repository.
Features:
  - Login, syncFeature, getAutoCompleteUserList, getTimelineFeed, getv2Inbox, getRecentActivity
  - Register (on progress)
  - Follow/Unfollow (on progress)
  - Likes/Dislikes (on progress)
  - Post photo/video (on progress)
  - Much more ...
